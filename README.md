# Hike Planning App

TRAIL MIX-ER

As an outdoorsman
I want to get information about a hike and plan an optimal outing,
So that I can easily plan my hikes

We want to design an application that takes a location from the user, and gives back an optimized hike for their desires.
EXAPMLE:

user wants a hike with low incline, easy effort

application provides possible locations, as well as the things they should bring and prepare for to have the best time(food and water to bring, clothing, time of day, weather, animals)

We plan on making it a modular recipe: user can request certain info.
We plan on developing this modularly as well, i.e. agile:
  We will deliver a MVP that can be easily updated, added to and changed.

# MVP
We want to be able to give the user the recipe for the perfect hike. They'll provide preferences: desired intensity, length. We'll give them a list of trails from closest to farthest from them, as well as information about weather(how to prepare for it), expected terrain(incline, rocky, city, etc), expected length, best time of day to go.
This will provide them with all the "ingredients" for a perfec hike.
